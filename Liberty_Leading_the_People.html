<b>Description:</b>
Liberty Leading the People is a famous painting created in 1830 by French artist Eugène Delacroix. It shows Liberty as a strong woman who leads a group of people from different social classes during the July Revolution in France, when the people fought to overthrow King Charles X. Liberty is barefoot and bare-chested, holding the French tricolor flag in one hand and a bayoneted musket in the other, symbolizing freedom and the fight for justice. She stands on a pile of fallen bodies, moving forward and looking back to encourage the crowd behind her. The people around her include workers, students, and middle-class citizens, showing that the revolution united all classes. The painting mixes realistic details with symbolic meaning, making Liberty both a goddess-like figure and a representation of the people's courage and hope. This work is seen as a powerful symbol of liberty, democracy, and the spirit of revolution, and it is displayed in the Louvre Museum in Paris.</p>
