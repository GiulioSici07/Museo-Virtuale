<b>Description:</b>
The Venus de Milo is a famous ancient Greek marble statue created around 150â€“100 BCE, believed to represent Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty. It stands over 2 meters tall and shows a woman with a bare upper body and draped lower body. The statue is missing both arms and some other parts, but its smooth flesh and detailed drapery reveal great skill. The figure stands with weight on one leg, her head turned slightly, combining classical style with Hellenistic details. Discovered in 1820 on the island of Milos in the Aegean Sea, it is now displayed in the Louvre Museum in Paris. The Venus de Milo is admired for its beauty, mystery, and influence on art, symbolizing ideal female form and grace.</p>
