<b>Description:</b>
The Mona Lisa is a very famous painting made by Leonardo da Vinci between 1503 and 1519. It shows a woman believed to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a rich cloth merchant from Florence. She is sitting with her arms crossed and looking directly at the viewer with a soft, mysterious smile. Behind her is a dreamy, distant landscape painted with soft colors and smooth shadows using a technique called sfumato, which makes the edges look blurred and natural. The painting is known for its lifelike quality, the calm expression of the woman, and the feeling that she is quietly watching you. The Mona Lisa is kept in the Louvre Museum in Paris and is considered one of the greatest masterpieces of art history. People have long wondered about the meaning of her smile and the true identity of the woman, making the painting full of mystery and fascination.</p>
